        <h2 class="about">About me</h2>
          <p>I'm a high school graduate with some college under my belt, I've worked many jobs throughout the years but the most recent one was for Sales Lead for Lifetime Fitness an upscale gym. I decided to take a course on programming because I wasn't feeling as fulfilled as I could possibly be and love to see my work actually translate to the real world and can possibly <em>help people with the new skills I learn</em>.</p>
